# Design System - Sass Stylesheets

This repository contains a collection of Sass stylesheets designed to follow the Material Design specification consistently across Angular applications. These stylesheets define a set of CSS variables that can be used to customize and extend the default Angular Material theme, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout your application.

## Key Features:

- **Material Design Compliance**: The stylesheets are structured according to the Material Design spec, ensuring consistency in visual elements like color schemes, typography, spacing, and components.

- **CSS Variables**: Variables are defined to provide flexibility in theming, allowing you to override Angular Materialâ€™s default styling easily and consistently. These variables cover essential elements such as color palettes, typography, and layout properties.

- **Angular Integration**: Specifically tailored for Angular applications, the variables in these stylesheets are structured to integrate smoothly with the Angular Material theming system. You can apply these variables to override or extend the default themes provided by Angular Material.
